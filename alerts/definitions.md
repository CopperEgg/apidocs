title: Alerts - Definitions
---

Overview
--------

Each of the API commands described here relate to the set of all Alert Definitions that have been created at your site. Today there are two types of Alert Definitions; those created for system alerts, (RevealCloud) and those created for website alerts (RevealUptime). 

Both types of definitions are presented and operated on in the same way by this API. Each Alert Definition is completely described by an Alert Definition hash. The key-value pairs within this hash are described in detail in the Create section.

List all Alert Definitions.

CURL Command:
{% highlight sh %}
curl -u APIKEY:U https://api.copperegg.com/v2/alerts/definitions.json
{% endhighlight %}

CURL Response:

Response is a JSON array of alert definition hashes. In this case, there is one alert definition, and it describes a RevealCloud 'Active Memory' alert.

Create
------
Create a new alert definition.

####Required parameters:
You must include a string describing the alert (defn_desc), the type of the alert, (system or website) and all components of the Comparison. 
   
* defn_desc  
    Your short text description of the alert (string); e.g., "defn_desc":"MyAlert".  

* type  
    A string that may be "ce_revealcloud" (system alert), or "ce_revealuptime" (website alert); e.g., "type":"ce_revealcloud". 

* comparison parameters  
  Refer to 'Specifying Comparison parameters' for the following parameters:     
  * comp_func  
  * comp_desc1  
  * comp_val1  
  * comp_val2  
  * comp_desc2  
 
####Optional parameters:  

* auto_clear_issues  
    Clear the issue when the alert trigger condition is no longer true. May be true or false, not in quotes; e.g., "auto_clear_issues":true. 

* notify_on_clear   
    Send an 'ALERT CLEARED' notification when the alert is cleared. May be true or false, not in quotes; e.g., "notify_on_clear":false .  

* auto_annotate  
    Create a chart annotation when this alert triggers. May be true or false,  not in quotes; e.g., "auto_annotate":true.  

* alert_duration  
    The minimum time that the alert condition must be true (continuously) in order to trigger an alert, in seconds (number). e.g., "alert_duration":60.    

* state  
    An alert definition may be either "enabled" or "disabled". If disabled, no alerts will be generated by this alert definition. e.g., "state":"enabled".   

* match  
    If not specified, defaults to match anything. To specify one or more tags to match, use the following format: "match":{"tag":\["TAG1","TAG2"\]}.     

* notify {campfire\[\],email\[\],hipchat\[\],pagerduty\[\],sms\[\],twitter\[\],webhook\[\]}  
    An array of notification fields; when a field is empty, no notification will be generated of that type. To generate one or more notifications for this alert, fill in the desired notification field(s) as follows:  
  
  * "campfire":\["CAMPFIREAPITOKEN","CAMPFIREROOMNAME","CAMPFIRESUBDOMAIN"\]  

  * "email":\["EMAILADDR1","EMAILADDR2"\]  
 
  * "hipchat":\["HIPCHATAUTHTOKEN","HIPCHATROOMNAME","COLOR"\]  

  * "pagerduty":\["PAGERDUTYAPIKEY"\]  

  * "sms":\["SMSNUMBER1","SMSNUMBER2"\]  

  * "twitter":\["DM1","DM2"\]   

  * "webhook":\["URL"\]
