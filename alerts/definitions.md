title: Alerts - Definitions 
---  

##Overview

Each of the API commands described here relate to retrieving, creating, editing and deleting one or more Alert Definitions at your site.
Today there are three **kinds** of Alert Definitions:
* those created for system alerts (RevealCloud),
* those created for website / port alerts (RevealUptime), and
* those created for alerts on custom metrics (RevealMetrics).

Each Alert Definition is completely described by an Alert Definition Hash, and has a unique ALERT_DEF_ID (alert definition ID).

Please Note:  Since this document was last updated, the API calls to specify notifications for have changed. While the 'notify' hash in the 
Alert Definition Hash is still present, it should no longer be used. Instead, you should begin using Notification Profiles, and
specify which notification profile / type should be used for each Alert Definition, using the 'alert_targets' array.

This process is explained in-part below, in Update Example 2. Please also refer to the Notification Profiles section for more detail.


###The Alert Definition Hash

A JSON-encoded Alert Definition Hash is shown in the following system alert definition example:

    "id":117439,                                        # unique ALERT_DEF_ID (generated by Uptime Cloud Monitor)
    "auto_clear":true,                                  # clear the alert once the alert condition resolves
    "notify_on_clear":true,                             # notify when the alert clears (whether automatically or when manually cleared)

    "comp_desc2":"95%",                                 # text description of the comparison value
    "duration":60,                                      # minimum duration of alert condition before an alert is triggered

    "updated_at":1350863583,                            # timestamp of last update generated by Uptime Cloud Monitor

    "alert_targets":[                                   # hash of notification profiles associated with this alert

##Create

Create a new alert definition.

####Required parameters:
You must include all of the following:

defn_desc
: Your short text description of the alert (string); e.g., "defn_desc":"MyAlert".  

kind
: A string that may be "ce_revealcloud" (system alert), "ce_revealuptime" (website alert), or "ce_revealmetrics" (alert on custom metric).  

duration
: This number of seconds that the alert condition must be continuously present before the alert is triggered.  
Valid durations (in seconds) are 60, 120, 180, 300, 600, 900, 1800, 3600. 

comparison parameters
: Refer to 'Specifying Comparison parameters' for the following parameters:  

  * comp_func  
  * comp_desc1  
  * comp_val1  
  * comp_val2  
  * comp_desc2    


####Optional parameters:
You may include any of the following:

auto_clear
:  Clear the issue when the alert trigger condition is no longer true. May be true or false, not in quotes; e.g., "auto_clear":true.  
Default if not specified: true  
 
notify_on_clear
: Send an 'ALERT CLEARED' notification when the alert is cleared. May be true or false, not in quotes; e.g., "notify_on_clear":false.  
Default if not specified: true  

auto_annotate
: Create a chart annotation when this alert triggers. May be true or false,  not in quotes; e.g., "auto_annotate":true.  
Default if not specified: true  

comp_val1_as
: This may be set to 'counter' or 'rate'. If not included in the create call, its value will be null, and it will behave as 'counter'.  
If set to 'counter', the value is treated as a counter; always incrementing. If set to 'rate', the value is processed as a rate, which may fluctuate up and down.  

state
: An alert definition may be either "enabled" or "disabled". If disabled, no alerts will be generated by this alert definition. e.g., "state":"enabled".  
Default if not specified: "enabled"  

match
: If not specified, defaults to match any tag, or no tag. To specify one or more tags to match, use the following format: "match":{"tag":\["TAG1","TAG2"\]}.  
Default if not specified: {}  

alert_targets
: An array of hashes, each containing a NOTIFICATION_PROFILE_ID and a NOTIFICATION_TYPE. To associate this alert with a notification profile, the notification profile must have been created previously.  
Default if not specified: {}  
Please refer to the Notification Profiles section.
