Updated January 30, 2017
  Added Gemfile with github-pages gem so that look and feel of website is same on local and production

Updated October 7,2016
  Replaced deprecated jekyll semantics.

To install dependencies: (require ruby 2.0.0 and above for jekyll version 3.3.0)
------------------------------------
$ sudo easy_install Pygments
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ bundle update


Here, bundle update is important because github always uses latest gems to host a jekyll site.
These gems are mentioned as dependencies of github-pages gem which is a part of Gemfile.

To see jekyll commands:
------------------------------------
$ jekyll

To Build Static Site:
------------------------------------
$ jekyll b

To Server Static Site:
------------------------------------
$ jekyll s

(to run a local server for testing and development purposes)
visit: http://localhost:4000


If something is building correctly:
------------------------------------
$jekyll serve --trace --watch
